# Teach Kids To Code
A work-in-progress document for researching resources to teach grade 6-7 students to code. Meant to be used with GIRLSmarts4Tech.

## [Made w/ Code](https://www.madewithcode.com/home/)
Tutorials created by Google with the goal of teaching girls to code. The language is block-based, similar to Scratch.
### Pros
Variety of activities
Activities should be fun for elementary school girls
Easy to point parents to, so that girls can continue working on other projects at home.
Nice interface.
### Cons
Almost feels like something girls could do on their own. 
The tutorials I tried out would be too easy for girls who have already done Scratch. And most of them probably won't take an hour. I didn't see anything with explicit loops, except the music tutorial.
Not much room for creativity (but customize emoji one could be fun)
