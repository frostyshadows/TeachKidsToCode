# Teach Kids To Code
A work-in-progress document for researching resources to teach grade 6-7 students to code. Meant to be used with GIRLSmarts4Tech.

## [Made w/ Code](https://www.madewithcode.com/home/)
Tutorials created by Google with the goal of teaching girls to code. The language is block-based, similar to Scratch.
### Pros
* Variety of activities
* Activities should be fun for elementary school girls
* Easy to point parents to, so that girls can continue working on other projects at home.
* Nice interface.
### Cons
* Almost feels like something girls could do on their own. 
* The tutorials I tried out would be too easy for girls who have already done Scratch. And most of them probably won't take an hour. I didn't see anything with explicit loops, except the music tutorial.
* Not very open-ended. Girls would be able to customize a lot of the end result, but they don't get to make anything from scratch.


## [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/)
Website allowing users to create functioning Android apps using drag and drop blocks.
### Pros
* Kids get to create real apps!
* Open ended, they can be creative
### Cons
* Logistics of getting devices/setting up emulators
* There are many parts to App Inventor, like palette, components, blocks, etc. Could be hard to cover everything in one hour. To mitigate that, we could just explain the parts that the girls will actually use.
