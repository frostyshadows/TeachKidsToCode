# Teach Kids To Code
A work-in-progress document for researching resources to teach grade 6-7 students to code. Meant to be used with GIRLSmarts4Tech.

## [Made w/ Code](https://www.madewithcode.com/home/)
Tutorials created by Google with the goal of teaching girls to code. The language is block-based, similar to Scratch. Out of the ones I tried, Wonder Woman was the most appropriate difficulty level.
### Pros
* Variety of activities
* Activities should be fun for elementary school girls
* Easy to point parents to, so that girls can continue working on other projects at home.
* Nice interface.
### Cons
* Almost feels like something girls could do on their own. 
* The tutorials I tried out would be too easy for girls who have already done Scratch. And most of them probably won't take an hour. 
* Not very open-ended. Girls would be able to customize a lot of the end result, but they don't get to make anything from scratch.


## [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/)
Website allowing users to create functioning Android apps using drag-and-drop blocks.
### Pros
* Kids get to create real apps!
* Open ended, they can be creative
* There are tutorials that we can work off of
### Cons
* Logistics of getting devices/setting up emulators
* There are many parts to App Inventor, like palette, components, blocks, etc. Could be hard to cover everything in one hour. To mitigate that, we could just explain the parts that the girls will actually use.

## [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/)
A drag-and-drop block language, from Google. The code is then translated into a "real" language, for example Javascript or Python, that students can look at. 

There's also [Blockly Games](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/?lang=en) which has puzzles for students to solve using Blockly, for example code directions to navigate a maze. They're mostly puzzle-solving.
### Pros
* Getting to see your blocks get translated into "real" code
* Nice interface, looks straightforward to use
### Cons
* Since it's getting translated into a real language, you can only do very simple things with the code within an hour. I would recommend choosing one of the Blockly Games instead so that the girls can go beyond printing "Hello World". But again, games don't allow for that much creativity.
* Focus on math, with some concepts that may be above grade 6 level (like x, y coordinates). Some of the girls might not like math.
